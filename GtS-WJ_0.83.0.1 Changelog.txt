CHANGELOG for Version 0.83.0.1 = V83 of the Collection

These are the changes compared to 0.83.0.0:

- Removed Dylbills Papyrus Functions. This was removed from GtS, but I accidentally kept it.

These are the changes compared to 0.82.0.5:

- Included a fail-safe method that prevents accidentally sorting the Loadorder.

- Included backups of loadorder.txt and modlist.txt. For further informations see the Readme.


CHANGELOG for Version 0.82.0.5 = V82 of the Collection

These are the changes compared to the initial Beta (consider that version as "0.82.0.0"):

- Leftover downloads. Some files of previous GtS Versions were still downloaded. This was an oversight. Don't worry, they were only downloaded, not installed. Fixed.

- Forced re-download of CC on first start: don't know why it happened, but it's hopefully now fixed with an INI-setting. BUT REMEMBER to follow the installation instructions and make sure your CC Content is already installed to your base game BEFORE installing GtS WJ.

- Resolution problems: Officially not fixed, but there is a super-easy workaround. Basically just another short step during installation. See the Readme or "IMPORTANT - If you have resolution issues.txt".

- Non-AE Version: I had hoped that I could organize the AE- and Non-AE versions in one download with two profiles. Sadly this obviously doesn't work. They are now 2 separate downloads. Make sure to pick the right one.

- The Rootbuilder install was actually faulty. Don't worry, it didn't have any negative effects. But it's fixed now.

- The Non-AE Version actually contained two AE-only mods by accident. Didn't have any impact since the Non-AE version didn't work anyway. But it's fixed now.
