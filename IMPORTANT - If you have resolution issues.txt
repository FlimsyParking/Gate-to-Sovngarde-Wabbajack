The following is also part of the main Readme, too, but listed here separately for better visibility.

With the changes in 0.83.0.2, chances are high that the frequent resolution issues are a thing of the past. But I'm leaving this here for the time being, in case users run into any issues with resolution.

- In Mod Organizer 2, go to the built-in INI editor: Menu "Tools" - "Tool Plugins" - "INI Editor".
- Select skyrimprefs.ini.
- Check if your resolution settings are right. These are the "iSize H" and "iSize W" values.
- Correct them if they are wrong.
- HIT "SAVE" AT THE BOTTOM OF THE EDITOR - REGARDLESS IF YOU CHANGED ANYTHING OR NOT. ALWAYS HIT SAVE.

This should fix the issue for most if not all users. 

If still have issues after that step, then they may be related too your Windows scaling settings.

If you're on a high resolution monitor (5k, 4k) but intend to play Skyrim at a lower resolution: for me it has proven good practice to lower your Windows resolution to that resolution before you install GtS with Wabbajack.

If you're on a high resolution monitor (5k, 4k) but intend to play Skyrim at a lower resolution: to deal with that lower your Windows Resolution accordingly before starting Skyrim. It's a minor inconvience, but the the best solution that I found until now. GtS includes tweaking to make SSE Display Settings and Frame Generation work together. However, this leads to the INI setting Fullscreen=1, which you may be used to, to become nonfunctional. This setting is not compatible with Frame Generation.
